HarotWii is a 100% MultiWii 2.4 version with some additional features such as:
1. Can connect to Baseflight and Cleanflight configurators.
	This version though is concentrating on Baseflight since Cleanflight is using a different flight modes and other cool features that Baseflight doesn't have.

2. Added new board called Gizduino and RCTimer CRIUS v2 AIOP. 
	RCTimer's CRIUS is using a different barometer board "MS561101BA". The default one that was using "BMP085"
	Gizduino - http://www.e-gizmo.com/KIT/categ/pmaster.php?dpage=/KIT/categ/kitcontrol.htm
	Test flight video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6NAJDCVOtA

3. Supports generic sonar module such as HC-SR04, SRF04, DYP-ME007
	Check config.h SECTION 9 for PIN assignments
	
4. Inflight PID tuning.
	This requires AUX2(3 way switch) and AUX3(Potentio). 
		AUX2(3 way switch) - Is used to adjust from P, I, or D. 
		- P is the LO switch, I CEnter, and D is the HIghest switch
		AUX3(Potentio) - Is used to adjust the values of P, I, and D.
	This will have anew boxname called "PID Tune"
	Check the sample video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVwk3JNQx6g
	Check config.h SECTION 9

5. Support for MultiWii Mobile Control for Windows Phone.
	This has new MSP called MSP_SUPRESS_DATA_FROM_RX = 150
 Once enabled in Windows Phone application, it will suppress all data coming in from your receiver so you can use the application in Windows Phone to control the quad with its virtual joystick with 4 AUX channels.

6. Can skip GYRO calibration at startup
	Make sure to calibrate the GYRO after you update the firmware.
	Configurable via config.h
	Check config.h SECTION 9
	
7. PID Controller
	PID controller codes are now in separate .cpp file called "PIDControllers.cpp" for future PID controllers
	
*Baseflight Configurator*
You can connect HarotWii to Baseflight configurator but there are some limitations such as in these tabs:
Configuration - Mixer, Serial Receiver, Battery Voltage, Board Alignment, GPS, Current Sensor
PID Tuning - 0.64 release now supports individual axis rates. You can still set Pitch and Roll rates by changing the Roll rate. That will automatically update the Pitch rate as well.
Servos tab - not working
